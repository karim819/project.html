    <h3> programming languages History </h3>
    <p> In 1949, a few years after Von Neumann’s work, the language Short Code appeared (www.byte.com). <br>It was the first computer language for electronic devices and it required the programmer to change its statements into 0’s and 1’s by hand. <br>Still, it was the first step towards the complex languages of today. In 1951, Grace Hopper wrote the first compiler, <br> (www.byte.com). A compiler is a program that turns the language’s statements into 0’s and 1’s for the computer to understand.<br> This lead to faster programming, as the programmer no longer had to do the work by hand.<br>
      In 1957, the first of the major languages appeared in the form of FORTRAN. Its name stands for FORmula TRANslating system. <br>The language was designed at IBM for scientific computing. The components were very simple, and provided<br> the programmer with low-level access to the computers innards. Today, this language would be considered <br>restrictive as it only included IF, DO, and GOTO statements, but at the time, these commands were a big step forward.<br> The basic types of data in use today got their start in FORTRAN, these included logical variables (TRUE or FALSE), and integer, real, and double-precision numbers.</p>

    <h3> what is The syntax!!!.. </h3>
    <p>Code is written in a language that a computer can understand. There are hundreds of different programming languages,<br> each with their own logic and syntax. A programming language has its own syntax, which consists of<br> the set of rules that dictate how words and symbols can be put together to form a program.<br>
      The concept of syntax in programming language is similar to the concepts of grammar and spelling in spoken language.<br> When a sentence in English has very poor grammar and spelling, it becomes difficult or even impossible to understand.<br> Similarly, when code has syntax errors, the program will not execute.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Statements </h3>
    <p>Statements are the basic unit of code. A statement can assign a value to a variable, <br>perform a single action, control the execution of other statements and do any number of other things.<br> A statement consists of a single line of code that does something. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Variables </h3>
    <p>Programming languages use variables. You can think of a variable as a container <br>in which you can store a value that can be retrieved at any time. In other words,<br> variables store information.Variable names can be just about anything,<br> but they typically cannot start with a number since the first part of the variable<br> would be confused with a number. Now you can do something with this string.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>An implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them <br>on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly,<br> two approaches to programming language implementation: compilation and interpretation. It is generally possible to implement <br> a language using either technique. The output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter.<br> In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach <br>there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting.</p>
